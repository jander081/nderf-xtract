James W NDE (13221)
Experience Description
The Unseen Contract: My Journey Through Death and Beyond


Introduction



Hello, my name is James. At 17 years old, I died. For most of my life, I lived unaware of this profound truth, carrying vivid, surreal memories that never quite made sense. I am autistic and have ADHD, with a mind that relentlessly catalogs and analyzes. For decades, I tried to fit these memories into the framework of my waking life. Were they scenes from a dream? Whispers from a forgotten book?



No, they were something far more extraordinary.



When I turned 50, a YouTube algorithm suggested a series of near-death experience (NDE) videos. One video, by John J. Davis, changed everything. As he described the hallway and the entrance to the orientation area, recognition flooded over me. Tears streamed down my face. For the first time, I understood: I had died. Those haunting images were real.



In my NDE, I experienced both the chilling depths of what many call hell and the strange bureaucracy of heaven. I was given a gift and an offer in a holding room. Upon my return to life, I encountered a figure—an agent, perhaps—who seemed to alter my perception of the experience. I also received glimpses of the future, a subtle ability to sense what lies ahead.


Chapter 1: The Silent Departure



All NDEs begin with the abrupt end of life, and mine was no different.



In 1992, at 17, I toured with the Cavaliers Drum and Bugle Corps, a traveling display of youthful passion and precision. Think of it as an elite marching band, a summer-long journey across football stadiums and gym floors in pursuit of perfection.



Show days were a whirlwind. Our buses usually arrived at the stadium between two and four in the afternoon. We performed late in the evening, giving us time to warm up, polish our instruments, eat, and suit up.



That day, exhaustion clung to me. I told my seatmate I would rest on the bus. As the backfield conductor, my absence went unnoticed.



It was not just exhaustion. I was already slipping into a diabetic insulin reaction when we pulled in at 2 p.m. For over six hours, I lay unconscious in the sweltering heat of the bus, a vessel without a soul. Yet in that void, the most profound experience of my life began.


Chapter 2: The Shadowed Realm



Almost all NDEs begin with an out-of-body experience. Mine did too.



I remember floating away from the bus. The roof seemed transparent. The inside was dim, just bright enough to see my body slumped like a shadow in the back seat. Then everything went black.



I did not see a tunnel of light. I did not feel peace or love. Instead, I found myself in a cavernous, underground space filled with brittle, thorny stems. The darkness was almost absolute, but I could see other beings—lost souls wandering aimlessly.



One figure resembled the subject of Edvard Munch’s painting 'The Scream', but even darker and more desolate. Other, more aware beings with glowing red eyes watched from the edges, their forms almost blending into the cave walls.



Although they did not threaten me, their presence filled me with dread. Assessing the scene, a clear and urgent thought struck me: I do not belong here.



Instantly, a brilliant light appeared to my right. A dimly lit stone road, like something from 17th-century London, led upward toward the light. As I scanned the road, I was transported onto it about two-thirds of the way up. Moments later, I stood at the threshold of a brilliant, perfectly white light, ready to step through.


Chapter 3: The Hallway and the Line



Leaving the darkness behind, I passed through the white light and immediately turned right into a hallway about eight feet long.



Ahead of me was a line, similar to a checkout line at a grocery store. The beings in front of me appeared human but were made of fuzzy, grey static, like a disrupted TV signal. Only two or three individuals stood ahead.



Curious, I leaned right to see more. The moment I moved, I was called forward.


Chapter 4: The Orientation and the Offer



As I stepped forward, my perception shifted. It was as if a veil had lifted. I could see clearly in every direction, in what many call 3D vision.



I stood in a vast white space with no walls or ceiling. A being sat behind a desk. Although I could not see him with my eyes, I perceived him completely, understanding his thoughts and emotions.



Behind me, four to six of the fuzzy beings waited their turn.



Communication was telepathic. I knew instantly that I was not supposed to be there, and that my visit would be brief. The being at the desk seemed flustered, uncertain what to do. After glancing around and shuffling through some yellowed papers, he made me an offer for my earthly life.



Although I still feel uneasy describing it, I accepted. I simply shrugged and said, "Ok. Yeah."



Relief flooded over him. As I began floating backward, I quickly mentioned that my earthly character was diabetic. He nodded to someone behind him and reassured me telepathically that everything would be fine. Diabetes would not be a problem, and I would have a great life.



It was a promise that has been kept.


Chapter 5: The Empty Stillness



After the orientation, I found myself sitting in a black, empty space. There were no galaxies nearby, just infinite blackness. I sat with my back against an invisible wall, feeling no fear, only deep peace.



As soon as I wondered what this place was, I was pulled back to Earth, where paramedics were working to revive me.


Chapter 6: The Return



Back on the bus, the driver boarded and noticed something in the darkened rear. Thinking someone had left a bag, he walked to the back and found me.



He pulled me out, limp as a sack of potatoes, and called for help. I have no memory of the time it took for the paramedics to arrive. When I regained consciousness, I vividly recall their shock at reviving me. Moments before, they had believed I was gone.


Chapter 7: The Unseen Observer



I believe my memories of the NDE were hidden from me until age 50 by someone present during my revival.



As the paramedics worked, a man stood extremely close—within a meter—watching me with a blank, emotionless stare. He wore a light beige golf shirt and matching pants and had a neat haircut. In the dim light, his clothes appeared almost white.



When asked if he knew me, he said, "I'm with the corpse," mispronouncing "corps." It was chilling.



I shook my head slightly to indicate I did not know him. When the paramedics turned to ask him to leave, he had vanished.



I believe his presence was intentional. He distracted me, allowing the memory of my NDE to remain buried until the right time.


Chapter 8: Glimpses of What Will Be


Vision 1: Choosing My Parents



Years later, while comforting my sister about our parents, I said, "Kids don't get to choose their parents." Immediately, I knew it was wrong.



I had a vivid vision of looking down at two sheets of yellow-pink paper, choosing my parents for the balance they would provide.


Vision 2: Michelle and the Future



In my senior year, a friend named Michelle asked if we should start dating. Before she finished, three crystal-clear visions overwhelmed me.



The first showed Michelle’s extraordinary spirit: intelligent, funny, sincere, and self-aware. She embodied the qualities I should seek in a partner.



The second revealed Michelle’s future life in central Wisconsin, surrounded by trees, boys, and a dog.



The third vision showed my choice. If I said no, life would be adventurous but it would take longer to find a partner as wonderful as her. A wooden boat sailed toward an island, a mountain rising in the center, the sun setting behind it.



Decades later, Michelle lives exactly where I saw. She married a wonderful man and raised a family. I, too, live on an island. That same wooden boat from my vision sits at the pier outside my home.


Chapter 9: Whispers from Beyond



Since my experience, they send me messages. My body vibrates when something significant is communicated.



I have even used this to predict stock market trends with surprising accuracy. When I ponder the concept of entropy as an explanation for that other place, my entire body vibrates intensely.



Small children, especially those who cannot yet walk or speak, often stare at me intently. They hold my gaze for long moments, making their parents visibly uncomfortable. I simply smile back, sensing there might be a connection beyond ordinary understanding.

But when I was in front of the orientation officer, I had 3d vision for sure... and not just 3d from my perspective. I can easily recall seeing myself from a floating third person view while talking to the orientation officer... I actually have memories from multipole camera angles of this experience in front of the orientation officer.
In the void before the paramedics got me out it was back to normal 2 eye earth vision.
In normal earth life at 17 years old I had no vision problems at all.
Please compare your hearing during the experience to your everyday hearing that you had immediately prior to the time of the experienceIt's possible I cannot remember 'hearing' anything.

What emotions did you feel during the experience?None at all... even at the orientation officer. He Let me know right away 'I was not supposed to be there. I would only be there for a short time'
Maybe they didn't turn the Love on for me haha.
In hell I felt discomforted by this weird place, but never threatened.

Did you have a feeling of joy?No
Did you feel a sense of harmony or unity with the universe?I felt united or one with the world

Did scenes from the future come to you?No
Did you come to a border or point of no return?I came to a barrier that I was not permitted to cross; or was sent back against my will While at the orientation officer.

What is your religion now?Buddhist Live in Thailand now, No real affiliation but live next to a Buddhist temple.
Did your experience include features consistent with your earthly beliefs?Content that was both consistent and not consistent with the beliefs you had at the time of your experience I have no idea what an NDE was... never ever thought of or could ever hope to even imagine what I saw there.
I had no beliefs for it to be consistent with. I didn't even realize what an NDE was until I was 50 and realized.
Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?No
Did you seem to encounter a mystical being or presence, or hear an unidentifiable voice?I encountered a definite being, or a voice clearly of mystical or unearthly origin I was with the orientation officer.
Behind a desk sat a being, immense in presence. I had no visual image of him, yet I could perceive him perfectly, understanding his thoughts and actions with absolute clarity. It's a paradox, not being able to see him yet knowing him intimately, but that was the reality.
Did you see deceased or religious spirits?No
Did you encounter or become aware of any beings who previously lived on earth who are described by name in religions (for example: Jesus, Muhammad, Buddha, etc?)No
During your experience, did you gain information about the existence of God?No
During your experience, did you gain information about universal connection or oneness?Uncertain I was there... we are connected because we are from there.
During your experience, did you gain information about the existence of God?Yes Sure the orientation officer was clearly more supreme that me... but god, no nothing was presented as that.
Concerning our Earthly lives other than Religion
During your experience, did you gain special knowledge or information about your purpose?Yes I they gave me an offer for this life that could be a purpose as well.
And I feel that I'm am supposed to share this story... make people smile and normalize NDE in our cultures. (it could be related to the offer they made me)
During your experience, did you gain information about the meaning of life?No
During your experience, did you gain information about an afterlife?Uncertain
Did you gain information about how to live our lives?Uncertain Yes 2 things
1. They made me an offer for this mortal life and I'm not comfortable sharing what it is just yet. Sharing it might jeopardies it from happening.
2. I can remember a bit more of hell then I really cover in my story.
Like the aware beings on the walls had red eyes. They were constantly scanning and pausing on a target every second... they looked directly at me too.
I can remember what the other beings there looked like, but it is a bit weird and much of it looks like beings that we have seen in one movie or another. I want to keep the story easily digestible for the masses so I don't do into too much detail about view I had in hell.
During your experience, did you gain information about life's difficulties, challenges and hardships?Yes I was in hell... these 'folks' there clearly had a rough go at it.
During your experience, did you gain information about love?No
What life changes occurred in your life after your experience?MY NDE experience happened when I was 17.
But I did not assign them to being an NDE until I was 50. I'm just 50 and 8 months now. So knowledge it was a NDE is only 8 months old... I want to tell everyone that the other side exists now, I feel like it is my purpose after knowing that I had an NDE.
Have your relationships changed specifically as a result of your experience?No
After the NDE
Was the experience difficult to express in words?Yes Not words so much.
But when I try to get AI to generate a picture of what I saw there... the picture NEVER does the image in my head justice. even if it looks very similar. These memories are so accurate that seeing something that is not exactly them feels weird. I cannot connect to an image of my NDE... only the visuals in my head.
How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?I remember the experience more accurately than other life events that occurred around the time of the experience. I died. For most of my life, I lived unaware of this profound truth, carrying vivid, surreal memories that never quite made sense. I am autistic and have ADHD, with a mind that relentlessly catalogs and analyzes. For decades, I tried to fit these memories into the framework of my waking life. Were they scenes from a dream? Whispers from a forgotten book? No, they were something far more extraordinary.
Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?Yes
Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you? Please explain.I was in Hell... I mean, that's cool right? Haha
Have you ever shared this experience with others?Yes Only since I realized these memories were an NDE. Which was 8 months ago.
Maybe shared it with 10 people since then. They all gave good reactions. You cannot tell this story face to face with everyone.
Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?No
What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?Experience was definitely real These were just memories of something I did... I didn't have context until I turned 50. The memories were real, I carried them from 17 to 50 without contact, but it defiantly happened to me.
What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?Experience was definitely real I didn't know at the time. Had no idea what an NDE was. These were just memories floating in my head without context.
At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?Yes, last month went to the museum of science of industry in Chicago IL. (amazing place it is)
There's an exabit there called 'The Blue Paradox'

At the start of that Blue Paradox show your in a glass room with video screens all around you.
I found myself sitting on the floor in this room with my back against the wall.
When the show started it got dark and an image like space flew by... that moment felt like exactly like when I was in the Void space before being pulled out by the medics.
Are there any other questions that we could ask to help you communicate your experience?All Good, well done :)
