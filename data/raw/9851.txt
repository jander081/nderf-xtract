Jose VS NDE
Classification : NDE   |   NDERF Experience : 9851
Experience Description
It was a weekday on the last week of May 1982. I was still a cadet at the Philippine Military Academy in Baguio City, Philippines. We had an exam around 10am on that day. The weather was very windy and rainy. After the exam, I and a fellow cadet, agreed to meet and eat our snacks. He went ahead of me and I followed him.

The next thing I recall, was going up a road made of rocks and stones. A black-hooded Being with no face was asking me to go with him. I said, 'No' as I ran all the way up the road, only to find myself beside a well, made of rocks and stones. I saw the same Being again. He asked me again, to go with him. I said, 'I will not.' As he was insistent, I picked-up two rocks. One rock was whole and one was flat. Instead of throwing them at the same being, I told him that we would clash our rocks and if he breaks mine, then I will go with him. But if I break his rock, he will set me free. As we hit each otherâ€™s rocks, I broke his.

Suddenly, I found myself and three other men on top of a mass of clouds. There was a big hole in the middle where I could see a bright, blue sky. I saw a long stairway going down but it was missing the fourth step. Two men went down the stairs. I was the third one in line to go down, but then I was afraid that I might fall. The other man told me that if I would not go down, I will remain in this place. Just as I stepped down, I found myself running in the middle of a road with lots of tall, golden-yellow grass and a big, round light at the end of the road.

When I reached the light, I woke up looking at the big, round emergency-room light. The Commandant of Cadets asked me where I was and if I knew what happened to me. I said, I only remembered stepping out of our classroom and that was it. He then told me, that I was electrocuted by a 3.3 kilovolts electrical wire which somehow severed due to the high winds. Luckily for me, I was saved by a plumber who was walking along the same walkway, following me.
