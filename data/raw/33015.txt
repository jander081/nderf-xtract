Experience Description

I was working on a counterinsurgency contract in Afghanistan in 2012. For the eight years prior, I had been doing logistics in Iraq. I came from a religious mother and grandparents, but religion never felt right to me. I had recently gotten married, and this was supposed to be my last contract. It turned out to be the most dangerous work I had done in all my years over there. I was alone most of the time, but thankfully, I lived just outside Kandahar in a compound with other expats. Most of us were former Marines, SEALs, or Special Forces.

Earlier that summer, I had been home on leave. We had just bought a home in Fort Worth, and life felt good; at least on the surface. But apparently, I had a strong feeling of impending doom. On the morning I was to begin my flights back to Afghanistan, I started drinking beer. My parents were visiting. I told my mother to take care of my wife and kids because I didn’t think I’d be coming back. We needed the money, so I went anyway. I don’t remember saying any of that. I was told later by my mother and wife. What I do recall is feeling barely sober enough to board the plane, weighed down by an overwhelming sense of dread.

I arrived in Dubai and stayed a few days. I wasn’t feeling well, but a local American doctor at a clinic started treating me for bronchitis. A couple of weeks later, while conducting late-night missions around the NATO base in Kandahar, a coworker and I were caught in a minor IED attack. It didn’t seem serious and not even worth calling home about. I had sustained worse injuries riding my dirt bike. I felt fine the next morning, but by that night, I was dying.

I don’t remember this part clearly, but somehow, I managed to put on my armor, strap on two guns, and gear up in full combat equipment. Then I crawled 250 yards to my best friend’s door. We called his portable building a “hootch.” This crawl, under those conditions, is hard to comprehend. Even in peak physical shape, my gear had always felt heavy. Doing it with a collapsed lung seems impossible, but somehow I did it. My buddy later told me he heard scratching at his door. He looked outside, saw nothing, and went back to bed. Around midnight, I made enough noise to wake him again.

He had been a Pararescue Jumper in the Air Force—the kind of medic who retrieves wounded soldiers mid-battle. With help from a Delta Force operator, they got me through a checkpoint and a brief firefight to the main hospital, 12 kilometers away at Kandahar Air Field. I have a vague memory of trying to draw my handgun to “help” them, but I kept drifting in and out of consciousness.

The two men later told me that the Role 3 medical team hesitated to treat me because I was a civilian contractor. They drew their weapons to stress the urgency of the situation, but it made no difference. My heart stopped, and only then did the staff act.

My next memories are fragmented. I recall parts of the near-death experience itself. I remember being with my wife as she flew to Dubai, although she was still in America at the time. My father arrived first. I hadn’t known he was coming, but somehow, I sensed his presence. I also remember my wife being with me on the medevac jet from Kandahar to Dubai. I didn’t know it was a plane at the time, but her presence brought me immense comfort. I can’t explain how, but it felt real.

Strange visions followed. I saw an imaginary patient in my room who died shortly before my own condition worsened and my heart stopped again. I believe now that he was a guardian angel. I also sensed the spirit of a newborn who had passed away in the ICU. When a code was called, I thought it was for the baby, then realized it was for me.

I drifted out of my body. The unbearable pain I had felt, even in a coma, was gone. I watched the medical team performing CPR. I heard a doctor urge a nurse to stop, but she refused. None of that mattered anymore. The pain was gone, and suddenly, I was somewhere else.

The place was gray, like the sky before a hurricane. Mist reached up to my knees. There was no sound or smell. It should have been frightening, but it wasn’t. I knew I was supposed to walk.

Eventually, I reached an enormous, ancient tree like those in medieval forests. My uncle, who had died from alcoholism in 2011, sat against it, unresponsive. Further ahead, my grandmother appeared. She had died in 2008 and was accompanied by my uncle’s father, “PawPaw Pete.” That surprised me, because I expected her to be with her husband. Pete called me “son,” just like he always had. Seeing him filled me with joy, but my grandmother refused to look at me. I understood why. I had become cruel and indifferent to the suffering I caused overseas.

Even though I felt tremendous relief at being pain-free and ready to die, Pete warned me. He said I would not be judged, but I would go to hell if I didn’t turn back. I caught a glimpse of damnation, and it terrified me. Still, I tried to continue toward a distant city that I felt was where God resided. Pete touched my shoulder, and I was instantly overwhelmed by agony. I woke up to an Indian doctor shouting, “Mr. John, you’re back!” Nurses were crying. So was I.

A few days later, after the tracheostomy was removed, I shared what I had seen. Doctors and surgeons visited, some deeply moved. One, said to be the best in Dubai, listened quietly and nodded as if he understood.

Later, I experienced something else. I saw a blue, electric figure urging me to rip out my IVs. I fought it, until my wife arrived and calmed me. I once thought it was a demon. Now, I believe it was my own darkness made visible.

When my wife had to return home, my sister came to escort me back. I was determined to leave. I bargained with a doctor: if I could walk the length of the ICU, he would discharge me. He didn’t believe I could do it. But I dragged myself out of bed, gripped a walker, and shuffled forward like my life depended on it. A taxi took us to a hotel in Dubai, and on May 5, 2012, I walked out.

I don’t have any grand revelations from my near-death experience. Some people return with messages of divine love or a clear purpose. I came back with nothing. I believe in hell, but I still struggle with anger and bitterness. I dislike most people, and it’s a miserable way to live.

There is one last detail I should mention. I heard prayers layered over each other, like the "emails to God" scene in Bruce Almighty. Voices from people in my Texas hometown came to mind, including ones I hadn’t thought of in twenty years. A churchgoer later told me it was intercessory prayer. Whatever it was, it worked. Still, I’m cautious now about what I pray for.

I should have died. Some days, when the pain is bad, I wish I had. But I accept this life as penance. My mother still carries guilt. She prayed for my survival, and while her prayers were answered, my health has never been the same. I struggled with painkiller addiction, then switched to natural remedies. I stay away from alcohol now. I’ve lost too many friends to it. I wish society focused more on alcohol’s damage than pain pills or marijuana.

I’m doing alright for someone who died; not great, not wise, just alive.

God, Spiritual and Religion
What was your religion prior to your experience?Unaffiliated- Nothing in particular- Secular unaffiliated, Raised in a Christian household, but it didn't take. I did not believe in a higher being. I'm not entirely convinced that Christ is the only way to Heaven. I believe there is a Heaven and a God, but I'm unsure about the biblical idea that Jesus is the only way to salvation. It doesn't make sense to me.

I don't see how God can let so much on Earth be so bad when God has the capability to do something about it.
Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?Yes, I feel like I've wasted so much time and opportunity. I am driven to do more with my time here. I went to school. I am philanthropic to the extent possible and even a bit more. Money means little to me. I like to make it and spend it too, so it isn't altruistic. I just told God if you allow me to have money, I'll share it. Seems to be working.
Did you seem to encounter a mystical being or presence, or hear an unidentifiable voice?I encountered a definite being, or a voice clearly of mystical or unearthly origin, I was surrounded by a guardian angel when I first arrived at the hospital in Dubai. He wore a turban and was also a patient in the ICU. He passed away just before my NDE. I don't know what this means, but I was not scared as long as he was present. After he left, things became unsettling with the NDE experience.

Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?Yes, I can sometimes sense when something is wrong, someone is pregnant, or something is about to happen. This doesn't happen all the time and there is no rhyme or reason to it. I just know some things from a sense of what I would call heightened intuition.
Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?Not one more than another. As a whole, it was a pretty unbelievable experience. I am not sure how anybody that hasn't had an NDE can believe those of us who have.
Have you ever shared this experience with others?Yes
